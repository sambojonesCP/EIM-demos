# EIM Demo Application

## Quick Start for Demo

### Option 1: Simple Double-Click (Recommended)
1. Double-click `start-demo.command` (Mac) or `start-demo.bat` (Windows)
2. Your browser will automatically open to http://localhost:3000
3. The demo will be running!

### Option 2: Manual Setup
1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org if not already installed
2. Open Terminal/Command Prompt in this folder
3. Run: `npm install` (first time only)
4. Run: `npm run serve`
5. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

### Stopping the Demo
- Press Ctrl+C in the terminal window to stop the server

### What You'll See
- Interactive EIM (Enterprise Information Management) dashboard
- Navigate between different insights and optimization workflows
- Tabbed interface with detailed metrics and analysis

### Troubleshooting
- If port 3000 is busy, the app will automatically use the next available port
- Make sure no other applications are using port 3000
- If you see CORS errors, use the server method rather than opening index.html directly

## System Requirements
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Node.js (for running the server)
